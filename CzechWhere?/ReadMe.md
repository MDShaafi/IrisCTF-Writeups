## Czech Where ? - OSI Challenge

# Solution

**Tip:** 'Iris visited this cool shop a while back, but forgot where it was! What street is it on?'

**Hint:** 'FYI: flag is all lowercase and _ for spaces. Please remove all accent marks if there are any. Wrap your answer in irisctf{}.'

Found a similar door on google maps
